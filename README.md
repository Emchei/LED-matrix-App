# Project Goal
This an experimental app for a research and design project with the aim of controlling content generated from an Altera Cyclone V FPGA and displayed on a LED matrix. The App connects with the FPGA via Wi-Fi.The FPGA is Wi-Fi enabled by a ESP8266 Wi-Fi mdoule. The communication between the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module and the Altera FPGA is via UART.<enter>
  **PLEASE NOTE** This repository contains only the source code for the LED matrix app. There are no VHDL source code for the Altera Cyclone V FPGA.<enter>
  However, there is only the synthesis folder generated from the FPGA during deployment. This repository only serve as an external storage space.<enter>
  This project was created as an example for the future electrical/electronic engineer student of
Fontys Hogechool, therefore the VHDL source code and Top level Architecture design were excluded from the repository.
